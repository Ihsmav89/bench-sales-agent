# Session Summary

## Date: February 11, 2026 (Session 5)

## What Was Accomplished
- Reviewed all X-ray search queries in the Search Roles page for quality/accuracy
- Fixed Monster/CareerBuilder empty location bug (always appending `""` when no location)
- Broadened Dice site operator (`site:dice.com/job-detail` → `site:dice.com`)
- Broadened Indeed site operator (`site:indeed.com/viewjob` → `site:indeed.com`)
- Replaced dead C2C boards (c2crequirements.com, c2cjobs.com) with active ones (c2ckloud.com, jobdiva.com, ceipal.com)
- Replaced dead Google Groups hotlist query with SimplyHired/BuiltIn/Wellfound X-ray
- Fixed vendor hunt redundant parentheses (`"staffing" ("consulting")` → `("staffing" OR "consulting")`)
- Replaced ineffective email harvest (`"@" "gmail.com"` pattern) with vendor contact + staffing directory searches
- Updated Glassdoor URL params (`sc.keyword` → `keyword`, added `jobType=contract`)
- Updated TechFetch query format (added `c2c` to query, simplified `jtype`)
- Added SimplyHired and Built In direct board links (8 → 10 boards)
- Committed and pushed fix as `1f50b1c`
- Ran full demo walkthrough of all 9 pages with Playwright screenshots — all working

## What Is Currently In Progress
- Nothing — all fixes applied and verified

## What Needs to Be Done Next
- All 9 pages fully functional — no known bugs
- Potential improvements: add deduplication logic to database.py, improve dashboard active counts

## Key Decisions Made
- Used broader `site:` operators instead of path-specific ones for better Google coverage
- Replaced dead platforms with actively-indexed alternatives (c2ckloud, jobdiva, ceipal)
- Replaced email harvesting with staffing directory searches (Google blocks email addresses now)
- Added 2 new job boards (SimplyHired, Built In) to direct link section

## Technical State
- **Files modified**: `src/bench_sales_agent/search/xray_engine.py`, `src/bench_sales_agent/search/job_board_urls.py`
- **No architecture changes** — query logic fixes and platform updates only
- **Tests**: All 18 passing (`pytest tests/ -v`)
- **Lint**: Clean (`ruff check src/bench_sales_agent/search/`)
- **Web UI**: Running at http://127.0.0.1:8000 (all 9 pages working)
- **Database**: 4 consultants, 3 jobs, 3 vendors, 3 submissions (clean)
- **Git**: Commit `1f50b1c` pushed to origin/main

## Resume Instructions
1. Run `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Run `pytest tests/ -v` to confirm tests pass
3. Run `bench-agent-web` to start Web UI if needed
4. All 9 pages should be working — no known bugs
5. Search queries have been updated — test by searching on Search Roles page
