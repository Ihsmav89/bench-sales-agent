# Session Summary

## Date: February 11, 2026 (Session 3)

## What Was Accomplished
- Loaded realistic demo data into the database: 4 consultants (Rajesh Kumar, Priya Sharma, Vikram Patel, Anita Reddy), 3 jobs, 3 vendors (Apex Systems, TEKsystems, Randstad), 3 submissions
- Note: Demo data was loaded multiple times causing duplicates (15 consultants, 12 jobs, 6 vendors total) — cosmetic only
- Took screenshots of all 9 Web UI pages for demo walkthrough
- Demonstrated the X-ray search engine with "SAP FICO Consultant" query → 20 Google dork queries generated
- Generated a hotlist email showing all bench consultants
- Provided full demo tour with explanations of each page

## What Is Currently In Progress
- Nothing in progress — demo walkthrough was completed

## What Needs to Be Done Next
- Clean up duplicate demo data in TinyDB (data/bench_sales.json) — reset to just the 4 unique consultants, 3 jobs, 3 vendors, 3 submissions
- Consider adding deduplication logic to database.py
- Jobs page shows "No active jobs tracked yet" despite jobs in DB — may need investigation of the route/template logic
- Submissions page shows "No pending follow-ups" despite submissions in DB — similar UI filtering issue

## Key Decisions Made
- Used Pydantic model validation to discover correct field names (VendorTier.PRIME_VENDOR, VendorRelationship.ACTIVE, Submission.vendor_name instead of vendor_id, etc.)
- Demo data represents realistic bench sales scenario: SAP, Java, Salesforce, Data Engineering consultants across NJ, TX, IL, GA

## Technical State
- **Files modified**: Only `data/bench_sales.json` (demo data added via Python script)
- **No code changes** this session
- **Lint**: `ruff check src/ tests/` passes clean
- **Tests**: All 18 passing
- **Web UI**: Running at http://127.0.0.1:8000 (background process)
- **Git**: Up to date with origin/main (prior to this save)
- **Screenshots**: Saved to /tmp/demo-screenshots/ (dashboard, consultants, search, search-results, jobs, vendors, submissions, emails, hotlist-email, chat, market)

## Resume Instructions
1. Run `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Run `pytest tests/ -v` to confirm tests pass
3. Run `bench-agent-web` to start Web UI if needed
4. To clean up duplicate demo data: delete `data/bench_sales.json` and re-run demo data script once
5. Investigate why Jobs and Submissions pages show empty despite data in DB
